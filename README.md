# PiCluster
I have recently been working on a Beowulf raspberry Pi Cluster which is going to host a webserver.

In this repository, I will be storing the necessary files for the Pi to sync for the website.

Sadly, the site will be local :(

I will publish a guide on how to make one of these within the next few weeks, so stay tuned!
